Generate Python code to implement the following requirement:

Requirement ID: {requirement[id]}
Description: {requirement[description]}
Additional Notes:
{notes}

IMPORTANT: Provide ONLY the implementation code without any markdown formatting, comments outside the code, or explanatory text.
The output should be pure Python code that can be directly saved to a file and executed.

Your code should include:
- Proper type hints
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Error handling
- Logging
- Unit test placeholders

Consider:
1. Thread safety and concurrency
2. Resource management
3. Error recovery
4. Performance optimization
5. Integration points with other components

Begin your response with the imports and end with the main block. Do not include any text before or after the code.
