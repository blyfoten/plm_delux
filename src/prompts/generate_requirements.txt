Generate requirements for an elevator control system's {domain} domain.
Context: {context}

Format each requirement as:
- ID (e.g., RQ-{domain.upper()}-XXX)
- Description
- Linked architectural blocks
- Additional implementation notes

Focus on specific, testable requirements that can be implemented in code.
Consider:
1. Safety and reliability
2. Performance requirements
3. User experience
4. Maintainability
5. Integration with other subsystems
